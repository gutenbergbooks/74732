<h3>THE PROBLEM OF THE FINITE<br>
AND THE INFINITE
</h3>
</div>

<div class="tall">
<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> influence of mathematics on philosophy
and vice versâ can be inferred from the historical
progress of both studies, though it
has not been possible till about within the last
fifteen years to give a logical explanation for
the relations between them. As long as it
was believed, according to the Kantian view,
that the science of mathematics was based
on intuitions of time and space, the alliance
between philosophy and mathematics could
not be proved to be closer than that between
philosophy and experimental science,
although the historical fact remained that philosophy
and mathematics exercised a mutual
stimulus, and developed at the same periods
of history.</p>

<p>But mathematics, as now defined, is independent
of intuitions of space and time, and
also of axioms and hypotheses.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Mathematics,
as now understood, is based, like formal logic,
on the prerequisites of thought, not on the
notions of space and time. Here there is
no definition of number or space, but the
conception of number and space,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which is
more complicated, can be derived from them.
All other complicated mind processes can, in
the same way, be reduced to the simple elements
of the prerequisites of thought.</p>

<p>Such a science might exist out of conditions
of time and space as we know them. It is a
science of relations rather than of mere number.
Founded, then, on the laws of symbolic logic, it
is a valuable aid and illustration to philosophy;
philosophy, on the other hand, can imagine lines
for the exercise of the constructive power involved
in mathematics. It is the object of this
paper to show that the close though apparently
accidental union of philosophy and mathematics
throughout the history of thought can now be
explained, and that the problems with which
pure mathematics is now concerned are those
which lie at the core of philosophic thought and
speculation. (Symbolic logic has developed to
meet the new demands made upon it. It does
not now reduce itself to the syllogism, as
Aristotle thought it did; the prerequisites of
thought are shown to be manifold instead of
single.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>)</p>

<p>The use of the word philosophic in this
connection suggests a necessity for further
definition. Philosophy is held to include at
least two great branches—&#8203;Metaphysics and
Ethics. The influence of mathematics is
most evident on the metaphysical side of
philosophy; in fact, the grouping of mathematics
and metaphysics as allied sciences tends
to bring out the essential distinction between
metaphysics and ethics, and—&#8203;though not by
any means to imply a break in their real
relation—&#8203;to show where this has been misunderstood.
No philosophy has been equally
strong on both sides; they represent different
forms of activity of the human mind; but it
is still true, and from the conditions always
must be, that an ethical system grows out of
metaphysics as practice follows precept and
conduct implies belief. The new definition
of mathematics does not touch these consequences;
it merely marks the limits within
which philosophy on the metaphysical side
can submit to, or rest upon, the conclusions
of mathematics.</p>

<p>As to the historical relation between metaphysics
and mathematics, the subject is so vast
that we shall only attempt a very rapid generalisation
of its results on the growth of the
conception of the Finite and the Infinite. (Of
course, there are many other sides of the relation
which might be studied.) The general
result of the inquiry has been, as far as we
can judge, that metaphysics has exercised an
inspiring force on mathematics, and mathematics
has defined and strengthened the conceptions
of metaphysics at every critical stage in the
history of philosophy. But where metaphysics
has been treated as the proof of science, where
it has been laid down as the foundation for
exact knowledge, the results have not corresponded
with the truth of experience, and the
quality of thought has become degenerate.
Progress depends on the right perception of
the relations between the sciences and parts
of philosophy.</p>

<p>Such progress is especially evident in the
early Greek and in the modern periods, while
the large period from the Christian era to the
Renaissance gives examples of the unfortunate
reversal of the parts of metaphysics and science
and consequent confusion of thought.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The problems of the metaphysician are no
doubt in a sense always the same; but this
is equally true of the problems of any other
science. The methods by which the problems
are attacked and the adequacy of the solutions
they receive vary, from age to age, in close
correspondence with the general development
of science. Every great metaphysical conception
has exercised its influence on the
general history of science, and in return every
important movement in science has affected
the development of metaphysics. The metaphysician
could not if he would, and would
not if he could, escape the duty of estimating
the bearing of the great scientific theories of
his time upon our ultimate conceptions of the
nature of the world as a whole. Every fundamental
advance in science thus calls for a
restatement and reconsideration of the old
metaphysical problems in the light of the new
discovery.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>During the Greek period mathematics was
the only branch of science which was at all
developed, and its development coincided with
the age of the philosophers. Thus when
Plato spoke of science he always meant mathematics.
And even later, when the physical
sciences had begun to develop, Aristotle put
mathematical ideas into close connection with
metaphysical ones when he stated that they
occupied the middle term between the ideal
and the sensible. Both Plato and Aristotle
referred to and depended upon mathematical
proofs and illustrations of philosophical questions.
During this Greek period the conception
of Infinity took shape. The pre-Platonic
notion, reproduced again later in the decline
of Socratic theory by the Stoics, was that
the Infinite was the aggregate of the Finite;
the Platonic and Aristotelian theory, that,
namely, of the most vigorous moment of Greek
thought, was that the Infinite was <em>more</em> than
the aggregate of the Finite; that it had a
self-determined existence from which the Finite
had been derived. Existence, as known to
man, was treated as a compromise between the
Finite and the Infinite.</p>

<p>Neo-Platonism altogether separated the Infinite
from the Finite. In the Alexandrine
metaphysics, which represented a decadent
stage of philosophy and its deviation from the
sciences, the conception of the Infinite became
less clear and logical; it diverged from the
view which had been affected by mathematical
thought, and tended to assimilate to itself the
ideas of perfection and universality, which,
philosophically speaking, are conceptions distinct
from that of Infinity—&#8203;universality referring
to a common principle of unity, and
perfection involving the moral ideal. Real
progress was deferred by the too rapid coherence
of ideas only partially analysed and
understood. Thinkers passed quickly from the
exclusive contemplation of subject to that of
object and back again,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> each new period
negativing all previous experience, till the
result was the exclusion of an imperfectly
analysed Relative and Finite from an insufficiently
apprehended Absolute and Infinite.</p>

<p>After the Christian era Greek philosophy
drifted off into scholasticism and lost touch
of reality, the grammar of Aristotelian logic
replacing the vital connection of ideas. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Anselm, it is true, attempted to find a rational
proof of the existence of God, and identified
Him with the Infinite of Greek thought; but
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas Aquinas led away the argument
to a discussion as to how far form and matter,
separately considered, shared in the quality
of Infinity. (He thought form did, but not
matter.) An overpowering sense of mystery,
joined to a premature desire for definition
without scientific analysis, sapped the vigour
of mediæval thought.</p>

<p>Throughout the middle ages, then, we see
the conditions of the Greek period reversed:
philosophy during the second period is not,
as in the first, engaged in giving a stimulus
to the efforts of pure reason; rather the intuitions
of philosophy are treated as axiomatic,
and a false superstructure of knowledge, alien
to experience and reality, is erected upon these
foundations. Philosophy, in fact, is used as
a general basis for science. The parts of
philosophy and mathematics, correctly though
imperfectly seen by the Greeks, are in the
second period exchanged, and the result
is confusion of idea. The notion of the Infinite,
as in the Alexandrine metaphysics,
is held to include perfection and universality,
and does not exist as a conception apart from
these.</p>

<p>After the Renaissance, the scholastic philosophy
falling into disuse, the attempt to find
an explanation of the Cosmos, a synthesis of
the universe, was abandoned, and replaced by
the Cartesian idea—&#8203;the inference of existence
from thought, and the limitation of the sphere
of inquiry to that which could be known by
the ego. New scientific and mathematical discoveries
kept pace with this new analysis and
development of thought,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and the surer ground
in philosophy was definitely allied with the
work of the mathematical mind. The philosophical
thesis developed from “The Infinite
is the negation of the Finite,” to “The Infinite
presupposes the Finite and does not exclude
it.” The problem of the Finite and the Infinite
became the great idea of the age, and there
was a reversion to the Greek notion of existence
as a compromise between the two, and
almost the hint of a coming explanation of
them. In the decline of Cartesian philosophy,
when it drifted off into Pantheism, there was
only a vague conception of the Infinite, and
we trace a tendency to identify the notion
of Infinity with that of the Cosmos. In
mediæval thought the idea of the Infinite had
become confused with that of the Perfect
and Universal; in the modern period the
effort to give a concrete expression to the
notions of Infinity, Perfection, and Universality
diverted the ideas from their relation
to the Creator and applied them to the
Creation.</p>

<p>Kant, who gave a new impulse to some
parts of the Cartesian idea, neglected both
mathematical proofs and the search for a
metaphysical Absolute. In avoiding the subject
he helped to perpetuate the vague descriptions
of the Finite and the Infinite, uncorrected
by mathematical thought, which had been the
currency of the philosophy of his age, and
which corrupted the philosophy of the succeeding
century. The nineteenth century
produced nothing more than guesses at truth,
which were, perhaps, not very far wrong, and
which the present century is engaged in correcting
and substantiating. The same vagueness
afflicted both mathematics (theory of
functions) and philosophy. Fichte, Schelling,
and Hegel, particularly Hegel, identify the
metaphysical Absolute with reality, infinity,
and the universal. The ideas of continuity
and infinity are not separated by them from
those of perfection and universality, nor from
one another, and their nature is not understood.</p>

<p>Leaving aside the French neo-critical School
(Renouvier) and the English School (Spencer)—the
first of whom deny the Infinite, thus acting
in opposition to mathematical reasoning, while
the second perpetuate Kant’s error of considering
the Infinite, though thinkable, as
unknowable (Dr. Caird has pointed out that
this position is illogical)—we arrive at a
moment in history which is more fruitful in
result on the mathematical side, and will, no
doubt, have an effect on metaphysics. For,
owing to recent discoveries in Germany and
England, mathematics is now in a position
to give greater support than before to the
intuitions of philosophy. Hitherto, philosophers
have been reluctant to allow full value
to the mathematical conceptions of Infinity,
and with some justice, as the notion had not
been sufficiently analysed. Philosophers, who
never attempted the analysis, have been inclined
to accept certain contradictions in their
conception as inherent in the nature of Infinity.
Within the last twenty-five years Cantor
and Dedekind have cleared up the notion
of continuity, and Russell has given greater
precision to the idea, and has applied this
reasoning to philosophy.</p>

<p>Present-day metaphysicians seem to be
divided into two groups; on the one side,
those who consider in philosophy the value
of a theory of being, and, on the other, those
who chiefly consider the value of a theory of
knowledge, <i>i.e.</i> the Epistemologists. The first
group, devoting themselves to psychology,
evolution, and history, have no <em>necessary</em> belief
in the Infinite. The Epistemologists, whose
work is founded on Kant, discuss the theory
of knowledge and enumerate the conditions
of knowledge. Their argument may not
touch, but does not exclude, the notion of the
Infinite. The position of the Epistemologist
has been made infinitely more secure by recent
mathematical work. That of the psychologist
remains almost untouched. It is
necessary now to examine more closely the
mathematical results to which reference has
been made.</p>

<p>In general terms it may be said that mathematics
has, as a study, led immediately from
the nature of the subject to the perception
of the Infinite, and to a knowledge of the
connection between the Infinite and the Finite.
The simplest form in which the idea can be
put is stated by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine, who said that
numbers considered individually were finite,
but considered as an aggregate were infinite.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Before <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine, and after him down
the long stream of philosophic thought, the
theologian and the philosopher have turned
to mathematics for illustrations of the infinitely
great and infinitely little, as developed
from the concrete processes of arithmetic and
geometry. The recurring decimal in arithmetic,
the properties of the circle and ellipse
in geometry, of the cone in conic sections, and
of the surd in algebra, all touch the problem
of number and space on the side of Infinity.</p>

<p>In higher mathematics it is possible to start
from the idea of the Finite and reach the conception
of the Infinite; or to reverse the process,
and from the Infinite to deduce the Finite.
Thus in the familiar puzzle of the subdivision
of the parts of a straight line by halving the
remainder, there will be a crowding and a
coalescing of the points of division towards
one end of the line, the points of division
getting infinitely nearer, but the steps will
never meet. Here in the centre of a straight
line—&#8203;a limited straight line—&#8203;we are confronted
with the problem of Infinity.</p>

<p>Again, from a series of finite numbers we
can gain the notion of an infinite series. Take
two series which have a correspondence with
one another. If for every element of the one
we can choose an element of the other, and of
the other there is an element for the one, when
at any point we cut off its progress to infinity,
this happens:—</p>

<p>One series, if summed up, will give a larger
numerical result than the other, and therefore
can be said to be greater than the second. Let
us call the first series A, and the second B.
Let us now imagine the two series, though
starting at a definite point, are never cut at
the further end. Then to all infinity series B
is without certain numbers which series A
possesses, <em>and as an infinite series</em> is smaller
than series A. But, on the other hand, when
neither series is cut, series B retains its correspondence
with series A. Thus we attain
a definition of an infinite series. It is such
that the part, while being less than the whole,
has yet a complete correspondence with the
whole. The whole is greater than the part,
but take away the part from the whole and
that which remains corresponds to it <em>in
infinity</em>, because the test of summing the
series (which would give a contrary result)
involves limitation, and thus cannot be applied.
Subtraction can take place in Infinity without
loss.</p>

<p>By reversing this process, and by starting
from the theory of the Infinite, we may gain
some idea of the discovery of the Finite. So
Dedekind and Russell define finite numbers
not only in the usual way as those which can
be reached by mathematical induction, starting
from 0 and increasing by 1 at each step, but also
as those of classes which are <em>not</em> similar to the
parts of themselves obtained by taking away
single terms. That is the reversal of the
process applied just now. Dedekind also
has deduced the Finite from the Infinite by
a novel process. He predicates a world of
thought which we each and all possess, filled
with thoughts and things, to each thing corresponding
a thought. There are thus two
“trans-finite” series in the minds of each and
all of us; we cannot say when the series of
thoughts and things will end; but they have
number, though it is infinite number. (Number
exists wherever there is a correspondence, one
to one, between two aggregates.) But in this
<i lang="de">Gedankenwelt</i>, says Dedekind, there is one
thing to which there is no corresponding
thought: that is the ego. Each man is part
of his own world of thought, but there is no
thought of himself in his mind corresponding
exactly to himself, as a thought in his mind
corresponds to another object.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Two important
results follow from Dedekind’s theory:
first, the existence of a finite number one, the
number of the ego, as deduced from the <i lang="de">Gedankenwelt</i>
of two infinite systems; second, by
putting together all the <i lang="de">Gedankenwelts</i> there
are or may be, we get the notion of series of
series, which seems to transcend Infinity, and
it gives us the conditions which are possibly
gathered up in the Absolute. Now the argument
from the Finite to the Infinite and the
converse process may both be employed in
mathematics (or both may be neglected, as in
the elementary methods of calculation used in
arithmetic). A discussion has taken place in
the <cite>Hibbert Journal</cite> on the relative value of
the two methods. Keyser, in an article called
the Axiom of Infinity, argued that one method,
that of Dedekind, should be exclusively developed.
Russell answered him, stating that
it was not necessary to hold exclusively to
either. If the Finite and the Infinite can in
turn be deduced from one another, neither
conception can be truly called an axiom. The
real axiom is existence, which includes both,
and which is defined by mathematicians as that
which is <em>not self-contradictory</em>.</p>

<p>Now the problem of Infinity includes also
that of continuity; in other words, the problem
of number includes that of <em>cardinal</em> and <em>ordinal</em>
number. It is time to get to the mathematical
definition of number, which we have found
as a conception can be attached both to the
Finite and to the Infinite. What is number
in mathematics?</p>

<p>Take any collection of things—&#8203;we call that
an <em>aggregate</em>. If an aggregate corresponds one
to one with another aggregate, they are both
said to have a number, and the same number.
Subtract from the idea of an aggregate the idea
of quality or kind, and order or arrangement,
what is left is its <em>cardinal number</em>. If you
subtract quality and not order, the result is
an <em>ordinal number</em>. This reasoning applies
both to finite and infinite aggregates; in fact,
the Infinite may be said to possess most of the
properties which we attach to the Finite. Two
infinite aggregates, for example, can have an
ordinal correspondence, and infinite aggregates
submit, like finite ones, to arithmetical
processes.</p>

<p>The mathematician analyses still more closely
the relation between the Finite and the Infinite,
as follows:—</p>

<p>He starts from the aggregate, which he
analyses into the Finite and the Infinite, and
the latter he analyses into the Transfinite and
the Absolute. Of these two elements, one
only has till just lately been the subject of
mathematical treatment—&#8203;the one called the
Transfinite. It is the transfinite subdivision
of the Infinite to which the idea of number
is applicable, and which is, therefore, in a sense
inseparable from the Finite. Infinite numbers
or series ought then to be more correctly described
as <em>Transfinite</em>. But the processes of
mathematics do not end here; they reach
up to the idea of the <em>Absolute Infinite</em>,
the conception of which has been attained
in recent years by mathematical work. The
results of this work may now be briefly summarised.</p>

<p><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> The Absolute appears to have the same
relation to the Transfinite as the Transfinite
to the Finite. If the Finite deals with numbers,
and the Transfinite with series of numbers, the
Absolute deals with series of series. Thus
there are at least two examples of the Infinite
within our grasp which lead up to the idea
of the Absolute. One is the class of all
classes of propositions; the other is the
series of all worlds of thought, in Dedekind’s
sense.</p>

<p><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> The Finite, Transfinite, and Absolute
can be further defined in this way. There is
no greatest finite number, but there is a least
transfinite number, which has been called Aleph
0, and which can be proved to be greater than
any possible finite number, however large, because
if there were a last number it must be
smaller than the sum of the whole series.
There are unending series of Alephs or infinite
numbers, which are as distinct from one another
in idea as 1 is from 0, and which can no more
be derived from one another by a mathematical
process than 1 can be derived from 0, but can
be reached in the same way by induction.
Beyond the Transfinite we cannot discover
in the Absolute the idea of least or of
greatest.</p>

<p><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> The relation of cardinal and ordinal
number also throws some light on the Finite,
Transfinite, and Absolute. In the Finite,
cardinals and ordinals are parallel to one another;
in the Transfinite they strikingly diverge;
in the Absolute we cannot trace any
connection between cardinals and ordinals, <i>i.e.</i>,
it is possible to have an ordinal series to which
there can be no corresponding cardinal number
or type.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> If arithmetical processes are applied to
the Finite, Transfinite, or Absolute, we get
interesting results. We know the effect of
addition, multiplication, and raising to a power,
on the Finite. The first two processes have
been applied to the Alephs; the last has been
formulated, but the mathematical results have
not yet been brought to a satisfactory conclusion.
Broadly speaking, we may say that
the raising of an Aleph to a power may make
it transcend the Finite and the Transfinite
and melt into the Absolute. Thus all mathematical
processes which find their goal in the
Absolute would find their annihilation there.
No finite mathematical conception would be
applicable to it.</p>

<p>Now the conception of this Absolute Infinite,
of which the aggregate of all ordinal numbers
is perhaps a symbol,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> has been subjected to
criticism. Some mathematicians<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> think that
it exists, but has no number. It is discovered
by a logical process, but defies analysis and
the application to it of the notion of number.
All mathematical conceptions find in it their
aim and conclusion. The importance of this
theory, its practical importance, lies in the
very much simpler mathematical formulæ that
can be produced now that the logical process
is shown to extend from the Finite to the
Absolute Infinite (in the same way that the
labour of summing a series arithmetically
by statement and addition is shortened
by the application of algebraical principles
which depend on larger knowledge). Its
philosophical importance is great: the Absolute
is here, as elsewhere, the goal of human
thought, and is the mathematician’s name
for the highest power discoverable by human
reason.</p>

<p>It would be very interesting to discuss the
probable attitude of a Pascal or a Hegel to
these mathematical conceptions, if they had
been aware of them. Take Pascal’s puzzle of
the Finite and the Infinite. He thought that
if the Finite could be subtracted from the
Infinite, the Infinite would thereby lose some
of its quality of infinity. How differently
would it have appeared to him had he realised
that an aggregate infinite cardinal can have
subtracted from it either finite or transfinite
terms: if transfinite terms, many different
answers result, giving different degrees of
transfinity: if only finite terms are taken
away, the Infinite remains in its entirety.</p>

<p>How, again, would Hegel have rejoiced in
a definition of thought and existence which
would bridge over the logical gulf in his
system! Hegel asserted that thought and
existence were one. He is objected to by
many philosophers, who ask where is the
<i lang="la">tertium quid</i> which makes it possible to reach
from one to the other, or predicate their
essential unity? But the mathematician defines
existence as something which is not self-contradictory.
Thought, then, to him is a
form of existence, for thought is not self-contradictory;
but the two, thought and
existence, are not necessarily conterminous.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Hence, to say that non-contradiction is a fundamental
condition of true thinking is as much
as to say that it is a fundamental characteristic
of real existence, and he identifies thought
with reality.</p>

<p>Dr. Caird remarks that the secular conscience
conceives of the Infinite as opposed
to the Finite; the religious conscience treats
the Infinite as real, presupposed by the illusory
Finite. Where does the truth lie? Mathematics
does not admit the necessity of adopting
either view at the expense of the
other.</p>

<p>Metaphysics standing alone produces results
that may be disproved, but cannot be proved.
Mathematics standing alone produces results
that are susceptible of proof. Both are based
on logic, and rest on the prerequisites of
thought. Together they are a field for the
best powers of human reason: metaphysics
supplies insight, intuition, imagination; mathematics
offers the indubitable proof and translates
the ideal into the actual.</p>

<p>But the element in philosophical thought
which, employing the psychological method,
tends to the discussion of a theory of being
rather than that of knowledge, and thus to
the realisation of an ethical system rather than
to metaphysical discovery, is averse from accepting
these conclusions. It remains, therefore,
for us to examine the criticism offered
by the psychological school on what they call
the mathematising of philosophy; and it will
be found that the attack deals both with the
ground of the alliance and its results.</p>

<p>A typical exponent of this school is Moisant,
who, in the <cite lang="fr">Revue Philosophique</cite> for January
1905, attacked what he considered to be the
characteristic of modern philosophy and also its
vice. It will be observed that at the outset
he reverses the <i lang="fr">rôles</i> of philosophy and mathematics
as we have apprehended them. Philosophy,
he says, should expect to be inspired
by mathematics, but should avoid its method.
Next, he connects the modern movement with
the theories of Leibniz, who aimed at substituting
general formulæ for elementary forms
of reason and calculation. These short cuts,
which seem to the mathematician to liberate
the mind from a burden which prevents it
from employing its full activity, seem to the
psychologist to tend to a mechanical method,
in which the thinker is only aware of premises
and results, and in which the mathematical
concept tends to replace the real idea. Then
he attacks the new definition of mathematics
as the science of relations, asserting that it
still contains notions of space.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Finally, he comes to the real question at
issue, and enters into the comparison of a
metaphysical and a mathematical problem.
He takes as his subject the argument from
the known to the unknown. Descartes had
said that argument should lead from the
known to the unknown, simple to complex,
and had defined the first as that which
could be known without the help of the
second. This logical order of reasoning has
been attributed to mathematics, but has been
considered to be inapplicable to philosophy.
Mathematics, in its recent development, by
the argument from the Finite to the Infinite
and back again, starts from two propositions,
neither of which can be said to be axiomatic,
because each in turn can be proved from the
other, but in the course of argument from either
mathematics makes use of the logical process.
The real axiom, as has been shown, is that of
<em>existence</em> or <em>being</em>. A metaphysical argument
has the same root—&#8203;that of existence—&#8203;but
a metaphysical problem deals with paradoxes,
with questions which are sometimes defined as
having two answers, each equally correct, and
sometimes as yielding no answer at all. The
method of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis is
in the Hegelian logic applied to their solution.</p>

<p>A mathematical and a metaphysical problem
are not, then, problems of the same kind to be
solved by the same method; nor is the conception
of the mathematical Absolute reached
in the same way as that of the metaphysical
Absolute. We are even unable to say how
far they correspond except in respect of their
absoluteness.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> But the contention of the mathematician
to-day and of the epistemologist school
of philosophy is not the identity of methods
and results in the two sciences. It is the axiom
of existence on which they both depend: the
law of thought by which all methods are developed,
and, above all, the <em>correlative value of
each science to the other</em>, which allows us, in
developing our knowledge from the standpoint
of the two sciences, to recognise something
of the greatness of the Absolute principle to
which they both reach up, and in which their
being consists.</p>

 Of course, if we comprehend in our view only elementary
geometrical and algebraical science, it is easy to show that
they <em>do</em> demand both axioms and intuitions. Take, <i>e.g.</i>
Euclid <abbr title="One one">I. <span class="allsmcap">i.</span></abbr>, where in the construction it is necessary to

<h3>PRAGMATISM AND A THEORY<br>
OF KNOWLEDGE</h3>
</div>

<div class="tall">
<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> question before us is the relation of Pragmatism
to a body of knowledge.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) One question at issue between the
Idealist<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and the Pragmatist has to do with
the way in which each defines knowledge and
gauges its ultimate aim. Both say that knowledge
is relative, but one school asserts that
the human mind slowly and laboriously uncovers
or discovers what Goethe calls the
“Living garment of Deity,” <i>i.e.</i> the world of
nature, and comes into a heritage of scientific
truth which increasingly corresponds to the
subject of his faith; the other claims that
we live in a self-evolving universe in which
in the course of long ages a new heaven and
a new earth may be created which are not foreseen
or implied in present conditions. In
other words, the Idealist finds the Divine in
human life; he finds in his own small corner
of the universe the microcosm and symbol of
Infinity: the Pragmatist considers that nothing
<em>is</em> which is not a result of human action, and
lowers the Divine element to the result of
individual human activity. A compromise between
the two ideas on new and interesting
lines has recently been made by Bergson.
The Christian doctrine of Immanence and
Transcendence also combines them.</p>

<p>Now the increase of a body of knowledge
would seem to depend on the comparison of the
successful working out of hypotheses with the
discrepancies from theory that from time to time
appear. Taken together, proofs and discrepancies
point to the evidence of a larger law.
This is Hegel’s logic, and the principle, so far
as it is here implied, is not denied in modern
times, for no one wishes to found a logic on
a study of discrepancies as such. Even W.
James says, “Whenever you once place yourself
at the point of view of any higher synthesis
you see exactly how it does, in a fashion,
take up opposites into itself.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In fact, without
the notion of unity, that of discrepancy could
not exist: there must be a background on
which the differences appear. The ultimate
unity is symbolised in the Idealist doctrine of
an Absolute.</p>

<p>The Absolute of Idealistic thought is not,
however, now conceived of (as the Pragmatist
would have us believe) as an abstract unity,
but as one involving a social bond, and hence
relations which can be described as personal,
if we remember that the Personality of the
Absolute transcends our notion of human personality.
Such a conception of the term
Absolute, a new reading of the theory of the
One and the Many, has been led up to by
Bradley and Royce by methods of logic, and
without any reference to dogma. It has been
conveniently expressed by Taylor. The argument
is briefly that ultimate Reality must be
One, Many, and Personal.</p>

<p>“For our conclusion that mere truth cannot
be the same thing as ultimate reality was itself
based upon the principle that only harmonious
individuality is finally real, and this is the
very principle employed by the intellect itself
whenever it judges one thought-construction
relatively higher or truer than another.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>And again:—</p>

<p>“If we speak of existence as a society, then
we must be careful to remember that the
individual unity of a society is just as real
a fact of experience as the individual unity
of the members which compose it, and that
when we call the Absolute a society rather
than a self, we do not do so with any intention
of casting doubt upon its complete spiritual
unity as an individual experience.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The Absolute has been stated in modern
thought to be One, Many, Real, and Personal
or Social, and these terms of its qualification
have been successively arrived at.</p>

<p>W. James’s words ring hollow when he
attempts to dissociate such a conception from
the reality of which it is the crown and inclusive
symbol, and type and essence. “I
personally,” he says, “give up the Absolute.
I find it entangles me in metaphysical paradoxes
that are inacceptable.” He allows that
there may be a God, though limited in power
and goodness, “one helper amongst others,
<i lang="la">primus inter pares</i> in the midst of all the
shapers of the great world’s fate.” In such
a system, as H. Jones has pointed out, “there
is neither in the universe nor in God any
principle to inspire or guide, or in any way
to bring about the amelioration desired. The
process is guided by no end. The universe
begins by being an aggregate of accidents, pluralistic,
discontinuous, irrational, and, of itself,
cannot become otherwise. There is nothing
actual within to change its character.… God
is himself finite, helpless to bring about this
great change, a part, and no more, of a
universe broken in fragments.”</p>

<p>Another form, and a very scholarly one, of
the argument against the existence of an
Absolute has been stated by Bax in the
“Roots of Reality.” He appears to have
reached the conclusion that the <em>telos</em>, the
goal of human thought, is not an Absolute
involving any notion of fixity, but that it
may be conceived of as a “moving synthesis.”
He argues that everything of which we are
conscious in the universe is seen against a
background which itself moves, and is only
realisable or distinguishable if it shifts upon
something relatively motionless behind it. He
concludes, therefore, that by analogy there is
no Absolute, since what we perceive always
implies something against which we perceive
it; thus that there is no goal by which and
at which the spirit of man can find rest. On
his theory we could never claim to reach the
conception of an Absolute, though he admits
the progressive character of human thought,
and the increasing reach, lucidity, and depth
of the human mind. The true answer to this
argument is that it proves exactly what it sets
out to disprove. As it is acknowledged that
only the permanent or the relatively permanent
can produce the phenomena of change,
so <em>the appearance of the goal of thought as a
moving synthesis would presuppose an Absolute
as a ground reality</em>.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>If in truth we were able to apprehend entirely
the source of all life and the background
of all experience, we might say that it did
not exist for us <em>as an Absolute</em>, but the fact
that whatever we perceive postulates an unending
series behind it, carries with it the
proof of an Absolute Infinite. (This conclusion
is led up to by the mathematician’s
idea of the series of all finite and transfinite
ordinal numbers.) Some part of this argument
has been already suggested in Ormond’s
“Foundations of Knowledge,” and so far was
used by Mr. Illingworth in the “Doctrine of
the Trinity.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>“From a deeper metaphysical point of view
it is the concept of evolution itself that must
submit to the determination of knowledge, for
it will be found that in so far as it becomes
epistemologically necessary to ground relative
processes in an Absolute experience, just so
far will it become necessary also to connect
the evolutionary aspect of the world itself with
a ground reality that is stable, and involves
the flux of change only as transcending and
including it.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The further answer that any judgment, even
the Pragmatist’s “judgment of value,” implies
an Absolute has been stated in his Oxford
Lectures<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> by Professor H. Jones.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The next point we should like to work
out is the relation of fact to law. The Pragmatist
denies scientific law and also logic, and
makes his appeal to facts. No conclusion can
be drawn from that denial except by the use
of logic itself. If he consistently denied logic,
his position would be unassailable by logic,
but he uses the method he denies, and is thus
open to attack. On the subject of the Laws
of Science the Pragmatist points out truly
that there is no actual continuity between a
fact and a law. But laws are concepts, the
result of mental activities; they are themselves
subject to the laws of logic. “They were
means, and you make them ends,” complains
the Pragmatist. That is just what nature
herself does. She perfects means, such as
the means of supporting life, and then these
become ends. Language, again, is at first a
means, and then becomes an end. So does
any science change its character to the onlooker.
A law, too, though it generalises facts,
is a limit on absolute generalisation. It thus
stands midway between the abstraction and
the fact. The Pragmatist, however, opposes
to law what he calls a new fact—&#8203;what should
rather be called a hypothesis. He asserts that
in every event, action, experiment, there is a
margin unseen and unrecognised by us; that
at every moment, therefore, the unknown, the
unexpected, may take shape and voice and
denounce all our careful and reasoned conclusions.
“Why should the sun rise to-morrow
because he has risen to-day and yesterday?”
asks the Pragmatist. “We are making an
enormous assumption,” he says, “in claiming
the uniformity of Nature and the principle
of causality.” The Idealist answers that the
Pragmatist makes a larger assumption in
doubting the truth of the principles, which
though relative and not absolute, still do work
out in practice, than the Idealist does in his
act of faith. In fact, the act of faith is rational
as well as natural; it is the act of doubting
that is in this case due to a mere scholastic
quibble. It is the Idealist and not the Pragmatist
who makes his appeal to the truth of
facts. Each day that the sun goes on rising
finds the Idealist in a better philosophical
position and the Pragmatist in a worse, except
on the assumption that the link between man
and the external world is a false imagination.
Let us emphasise:—It is the Pragmatist who
quibbles with logic, and the Idealist who
appeals to facts.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Now there are certain facts and certain
deductions from facts, well known to mathematicians,
which we should like to quote here
as having a bearing on the theory of the
Absolute, because they deal with aspects
of Infinity, and mark a connection between
the world as we know it and the concepts
of the philosopher. All have the support of
science, and furnish the Idealist philosopher
with examples which support his theories, and
strengthen his position in the face of the
Pragmatist attack. They have to do with
the theory of Infinity as shown in:—</p>

<p><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> The Indefinite Regress.</p>

<p><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> Infinite series.</p>

<p><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> Dimensions in space and time.</p>

<p>Before entering upon them we must repeat
that the question of number and series in
mathematics is independent of the assumptions
of space and time. As a science, mathematics
could exist outside them: order is not
necessarily spatial or temporal. Our conclusions,
therefore, cannot be attacked on the
ground that they are based on Euclidean
conceptions of space: they are based on the
laws of logic.</p>


<p><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> <span class="smcap">The Indefinite Regress</span></p>

<p>Hume and, later, Kant argued that by the
principle of association when we think of one
quality of a thing the others are naturally
brought before our minds, and thus that we
get into the habit of attributing to the notion
of the thing a certain group of qualities. And
it is true that we do attend to a thing all at
once, including in the notion of it all the
qualities which we know belong to it.</p>

<p>Now experience, according to Leibniz, gives
us an example of a unity which embraces a
multiplicity of detail. Thus a thing is one
substance as embodying an individual experience,
and its qualities belong to it in the
same sense as the constituents of experience
belong to the single experience. These qualities
are in relation. (The Pragmatist denies
the existence of relations as part of a
higher unity.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>) But they are not only relation,
since relation always implies something
more than itself. Let us take the
example of number. Numbers could never
have been counted if there had not been things
to count. Now suppose each quality could
be analysed into a new relation, we should
still not get rid of the quality. At each stage
there remains a quality in relation, and this
goes on to Infinity. Such a constant subdivision
perhaps results from our finite experience
seizing facts in a disjointed way.
When we analyse a law in its working, we
always do seem to come to this Indefinite
Regress. Now it has been the reproach against
metaphysics, as uttered by the Pragmatist,
that there is no correspondence in scientific
fact to this road into Infinity.</p>

<p>W. James asserts: “But in point of fact,
nature doesn’t make eggs by making first half
an egg, then a quarter, then an eighth, &amp;c., and
adding them together. She either makes a
whole egg at once or none at all, and so of
all her other units. It is only in the sphere
of change, then, where one phase of a thing
must needs come into being before another
phase can come, that Zeno’s paradox gives
trouble. And it gives trouble then only if
the successive steps of change be infinitely
divisible.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The sphere of change, however, one would
answer, includes all nature, and science in its
discoveries acts on the hypothesis that these
steps of change may be infinitely divisible.
Royce held to it firmly that any consistent
attempt to make an orderly arrangement of the
terms of an infinite whole must lead to the Indefinite
Regress. And he further shows the connection
with the fact that an infinite series can
be adequately represented by a part of itself.</p>

<p>In the Boyle Lecture, delivered in Oxford in
1908, on the properties of radium, two facts
emerged which show that the Indefinite Regress
is now recognised in science.</p>

<p>First, that in the region of experiment we
become aware of groups of elements allied to
radium, which seem, in the number of individuals
in their groups, to follow a simple
arithmetical progression.</p>

<p>Secondly, that radio-active elements lose in
activity at a certain rate, which always represents
an exact proportion of the mass which
remains. The tremendous disintegrating force
slackens in exact relation to the time which
passes, so that the smaller the morsel the less
the relative loss of mass. Here, then, is the
Indefinite Regress. In the world of fact as
well as of ideas we are dealing with aspects of
Infinity.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>


<p><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Infinite Series</span></p>

<p>There are other aspects of Infinity which
we can get at by studying series, and which in
the conception of series of series give strength
and point to the philosophic conception of an
Absolute.</p>

<p>Prof. C. Keyser develops this thought, and
shows (in two recent articles, January and
April 1909, in the <cite>Hibbert Journal</cite>) that certain
theological dogmas, such as the doctrine of the
Trinity, and certain attributes of the Divine
Being, such as Omniscience and Omnipresence,
are entirely conceivable by the human mind
if regarded without the paralysing limitations
of the Finite. He shows that in our mathematical
formulæ which have to do with infinite
series we have the exact replica of what to
the lay, non-mathematical mind seem to be
the paradoxes of the Athanasian Creed. He
first shows that in a mathematical analogy
points of view about an Infinite Being, even if
partially discordant, may all be true if regard
is had to His Infinity.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Further, he shows that certain assumptions,
such as <em>the whole is greater than its part</em>,
are inapplicable to Infinite Being. The conception
of a Trinity in Unity in which “none
is afore or after other, none is greater or less
than another, but the whole three persons are
co-eternal together and co-equal” is rationally
conceivable by the mathematician who is familiar
with the theory of manifolds.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>We have, he shows, three infinite manifolds:—</p>

<p>E of the even integers.</p>

<p>O of the odd ones.</p>

<p>F of the fractions having integers for their
terms.</p>

<p>No two of these have a single element in
common, yet the three together constitute one
manifold M, that is exactly equal in wealth of
elements to <em>each</em> of its infinite components.</p>

<p>Again, there is the apparent opposition between
the Omniscience of God and the freedom
of man. The antithesis disappears if we realise
that from the point of view of Infinites the
dignity and power of Omniscience remain the
same, even if some part of experience is not
yet drawn into the sphere of Omniscience.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Here we have the present conceived of as
a moving plane separating the unknown from
the known. The “past” can be said to be
known, though its content changes every instant.
This is the real answer to W. James’s cry that
he could accept an Absolute if it had even
the fragment of an “other.” There can be
this “other,” and yet the Absolute still remains
an Absolute.</p>

<p>The doctrine of <em>Omnipresence</em> follows from
the argument of the Continuum (which is the
aggregate of all real numbers). Thus the
number of points in space of infinite dimension
is no greater than the number of points in any
part of space as known to us. The whole
is incarnate in every part, because to each
part, in however small an atom, corresponds
a point in the universal whole, and the number
of points in a space of infinite dimensions is
equal to the number of points in a straight
line however small.</p>

<p>And this is true not merely of points but
also of forces. “The Universe is dynamic,
charged throughout with innumerable modes
of motion. Each point, however, of any moving
thing—&#8203;an ion of gas, a vibrating fibre of brain—&#8203;is
represented by a corresponding point in S
(a small typical atom), and so within the tiny
sphere—&#8203;indeed, in every room, however small—&#8203;the
whole dynamics of the universe is depicted
completely and co-enacted by motion of points
and transformation of point configurations.
There in miniature proceed at once the countless
play and interplay of every kind of motion,
small and large, simple and complex, the
quivering dance of the molecule, the wave and
swing of universal æther.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>


<p><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Dimensions in Space</span></p>

<p>There is another argument, one relating to
the theories of time and space, which greatly
affects the conception of omnipresence. This
is the argument of the many dimensions, called
by Keyser the “radiant concept of hyper-space,
which only a generation ago was regarded, even
by mathematicians—&#8203;most adventurous of men—&#8203;as
being purposeless and vain, but which
meanwhile has advanced so rapidly to commanding
position that even the following statement
by Poincaré, in his recent address before
the International Mathematical Congress at
Rome on ‘L’Avenir des Mathématiques,’ is
well within the limits of conservatism: ‘Nous
sommes aujourd’hui tellement familiarisés avec
cette notion que nous pouvons en parler,
même dans un cours d’université, sans provoquer
trop d’étonnement.’ The fact is that the
doctrine already exists in a vast and rapidly
growing literature, flourishes in all the scientific
languages of the world, and in its essential
principles has become for mathematics as
orthodox as the multiplication table.”</p>

<p>The present position of the theory is briefly
this: If there did not exist a fourth dimension,
we could not be aware of a third as such, and so
on. Are we then looking out upon a third
dimensional world, and realising it as such
because we are mentally capable of conceiving
dimensions beyond it? Our world sensibly
contains one dimensional and two dimensional
facts—&#8203;the first such as a time series, for
which one number is sufficient to fix a point,
and the second such as a plane where position
can be fixed by two numbers. Does our
world contain facts of other dimensions?</p>

<p>“All particles of air are four-dimensional
in magnitude when, in addition to their position
in space, we also consider the variable densities
which they assume, as they are expressed by
the different heights of the barometer in the
different parts of the atmosphere. Similarly
all conceivable spheres in space are four-dimensional
magnitudes, for their centres form a
three-dimensional point-aggregate, and around
each centre a one-dimensional totality of
spheres, the radii of which can be expressed
by every numerical magnitude from zero to
infinity. Further, if we imagine a measuring-stick
of invariable length to assume every
conceivable position in space, the positions so
obtained will constitute a five-dimensional aggregate.
For in the first place one of the extremities
of the measuring-stick may be conceived
to assume a position at every point of space, and
this determines for one extremity alone of the
stick a three-dimensional totality of position,
and, secondly, as we have seen above, there proceeds
from every such position of this extremity
a two-dimensional totality of directions, and by
conceiving the measuring-stick to be placed
lengthwise in every one of these directions,
we shall obtain all the conceivable positions
which the second extremity can assume, and
consequently the dimensions must be 3 + 2 or
5 …” &amp;c., &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Mathematicians have for long done problems
in the seventh and eighth dimensions. They
have told us that you cannot tie a knot in the
second dimension, because there is no up or
down, and the threads would not cross—&#8203;nor in
the fourth, because the knot would pull out in
a new direction and would not hold. But it
has only lately been realised that fourth and
other dimensions may be actual fact in the
world round us. Of course, from the point of
view of a point there are only three dimensions
to be known, but to a line in the same
space there are five, to the surface probably
six. Our intelligence at present does not go
beyond the point; but if we could think of
space from the point of view of a solid,
worlds upon worlds would rise before our
view.</p>

<p>Of the fourth dimension we can discover
some facts by analogy. We can count the
edges of its typical figure, and apply thought
to determining some of its conditions. But
a more interesting subject of research is the
inquiry into the light thrown by the theory
of four dimensions on the determination of
certain atoms in chemistry, that are known to
be distinct elements, but could only be determined
actually in another dimension.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>“In chemistry, the molecules of a compound
body are said to consist of the atoms of the
elements which are contained in the body, and
these are supposed to be situated at certain
distances from one another and to be held in
their relative positions by certain forces. At
first the centres of the atoms were conceived to
lie in one and the same plane. But Wislicenus
was led by researches in paralactic acid to
explain the differences of isomeric molecules of
the same structural formulæ by the different
positions of the atoms in <em>space</em>. In fact, four
points can always be so arranged in space that
every two of them may have any distance from
each other; and the change of one of the six
distances does not necessarily involve the
alteration of any other.</p>

<p>“But suppose our molecule consists of five
atoms? Four of these may be so placed that
the distance between any two of them can
be made what we please. But it is no longer
possible to give the fifth atom a position such
that each of the four distances by which it is
separated from the other atoms may be what
we please. On the contrary, the fourth distance
is dependent on the three remaining
distances, for the space of experience has
only three dimensions. If, therefore, I have a
molecule which consists of five atoms, I cannot
alter the distance between two of them without
at least altering some second distance. But
if we imagine the centres of the atoms placed
in a four-dimensioned space, this can be done;
all the ten distances which may be conceived
to exist between the five points will then be
independent of one another. To reach the
same result in the case of six atoms we must
assume a five-dimensional space, and so on.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Here we see that if chemistry as a science
is bound to take account of all its facts, the
scientist is confronted with a problem of dimensions
that is really a problem of Infinity
applied not, as in the other cases quoted, to
number, but to space.</p>

<p>And there is a reason which explains why
the same problem tends to appear in these
different ways. Both time and space can be
most correctly thought of as <em>series</em>: the former
known to us as possessing one direction, though
possibly involving more, and the latter three,
though possibly involving more. Time is
not a thing nor a condition, but it is the
way in which we are enabled to apprehend
the relations of actions to one another. The
assumption of the Pragmatist, that a different
date in history is a new condition which might
affect a chemical experiment, is meaningless,
unless by that he intends to say that at the
different date new conditions prevailed.</p>

<p>The general conclusion of recent thought
is then to establish the Idealist position more
strongly by an appeal to mathematical argument.
This argument is strengthened by finding at
the present time some support in scientific fact
and experiment. The Idealist therefore appeals
to fact, and his position rests ultimately on a
truth which has its aspects of conformity with
scientific experiment and with logical or mathematical
proof.</p>

 A succession of what is disconnected is not change. Change
is a succession within an identity: if not within the identity,
there is no change, only analysis and re-grouping. The closer
our knowledge is of ourselves or anything else, the more we
see that <em>change is the expression in time of an identity</em>.</p>
